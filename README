This is a PHP implementation of .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure (MC-NBFX).

The official specification can be found at:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc219210(PROT.10).aspx

Requirements:
* XMLWriter (PHP extension)
* MBString (PHP extension)
* GMP (PHP extension)

Known/Missing issues:
* only decoding is supported
* timespan not implemented
* local timezone offset in datetime

Specification inconsistencies:

1) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc219251(v=PROT.10).aspx says that
"If the hour, minutes, seconds, and fraction of second parts are zero, the date MUST
be interpreted as the following characters. yyyy-MM-dd". That does not
match the examples.

2) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc219270(v=PROT.10).aspx says that
UnicodeChars32TextRecord MUST be encoded using MultiByteInt31. That does not
match the examples.
